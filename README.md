# EduChain
EduChain transforms how academic and professional credentials are issued and verified by leveraging the Hedera Token Service (HTS). Educational institutions can issue tokenized diplomas, certificates, and transcripts directly to students' wallets, ensuring secure, tamper-proof ownership of their academic achievements.
